# Unreal-Engine-New-Library
we are finishing very long and tiring complex codes. We develop the bp fast, simple and optimized new library together with our team.

* = Quality Each Loop = Thanks to the optimized loop system and delay, there is never an infinite loop error, it does not cause stuttering or freezing. It may cause some problems but should be constantly checked while using!

* = Infite Loop Delay = provides unlimited loops with delay but We can turn it off and on whenever we want. Lets you loop inside a loop and very useful for checking a branch by using it as a continuous click.

![ClassOverlap](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112575364/211673252-67e8034b-6526-4357-a337-273ff46288af.png)

* = Class Overlap = creates a event actor begin overlap of your chosen class. You can start overlap by calling a class in any code writing and you can get the values of the class.

![ClassOverlapEnd](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112575364/211674157-98f40755-f166-41cb-9de6-6a68fbf29262.png)

* = Class Overlap End = creates a actor event end overlap of your chosen class. You can start overlap by calling a class in any code writing and you can get the values of the class.

![ClassHit](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112575364/211674765-290ab05e-fc4c-4cea-99ba-3e0b6f99ebec.png)

* = Class Hit = creates a actor hit of your chosen class. You can start overlap by calling a class in any code writing and you can get the values of the class.

![ClassClicked](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112575364/211675056-e57f28e8-2bba-43de-aae4-bc3e84edf119.png)

* = Class Clicked = Creates an actor event by clicking on the class of your choice. You can start overlapping and get the values of the class by calling a class in any script.

![ClassSetLocation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112575364/211676364-c595c00a-c270-40c5-bbb5-8294c1aa8f42.png)

* = Class Set Location = Changes the position of the index value of the class you entered

![Line Trace Class](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112575364/211677080-25edd4b5-5014-4562-96ce-081ce06356e6.png)

* = Line Trace Class = hits your chosen class. You can get your class values like this and cast successfully Or it can be used for other things.

![LineTraceClassAll](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112575364/211677524-19bb5b8e-e439-4326-9fea-f827bf776fb3.png)

* = Line Trace Class All = hits all objects of your chosen class. You can get your class values like this and cast successfully Or it can be used for other things.
